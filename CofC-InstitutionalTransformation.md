# Challenge of Change: Institutional Transformation

![](Food%20Security%20Wagon%20Wheel%20Diagram.png)

## Cross-Cutting Issues
Cutting across all three components of food security, as well as the domestic and global aspects of the work of the commission are four factors: Institutional Transformation of public universities, Climate Change, the Policy Environment, and Environmental Effects and Impacts. These four cross-cutting issues should be embedded across all eight working groups as opposed to forming working groups of their own. This approach will ensure that the cross cutting issues will be considered within the context of the working group topics. The Commission will integrate the cross cutting issues into the challenges identified by the working groups.

## Institutional Transformation
Historically, our North American public universities have been instrumental in solving agricultural challenges, but todayâ€™s food security issues are even more complex. These issues are multidimensional, crossing disciplinary and national borders, and solving them requires understanding food systems and how they interact with the social and economic environment to make positive change happen. Universities may be the only place where all relevant disciplines come together to address these complex, systemic issues. The commission will identify, drawing on external expertise, an initial framework of the required research, institutional strengthening, human resources requirements and university organization and function needed to meet this challenge.  
  
Institutional transformation is particularly critical for developing countries, and it is hoped that the lessons learned for transformation of North American public universities could also be adapted to create institutional transformation for public universities in developing countries. For example, Africa is faced with promise and peril. One half of the 2 billion plus people to be added to the planet by 2050 will be African. Over the next decades, the continent will either be a source of human capital and creativity to produce the science and social conditions for food security or a source of instability that makes food insecurity a continental challenge. The quality of higher education institutions in developing countries is critical in determining that outcome.
