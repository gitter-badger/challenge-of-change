# Challenge of Change: Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions Working Group

## Component Two: Access
The second component of food security, Access, means having sufficient resources and access to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious and culturally appropriate diet. As with availability, access has a number of contributing factors. Local populations must be able to participate in an enabling environment that allows input into the food systems. Factors related to inclusion and equity across a number of considerations are also critical.

## Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions
All people deserve access to healthy and affordable food, and local, national and international policy environments that enable this access and which provide opportunities for engagement. Local communities can be empowered to have more input into both local and national food systems.
