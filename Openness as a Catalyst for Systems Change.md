# Openness as a Catalyst for Systems Change

Given this report is from our vantage point as a working group, it would advantageous for us to identify opportunities by which APLU in partnership with Commission members can drive **_institutional transformation_** among actors in the global food system to “ensure universal food security by 2050.”

## Openness
**_Openness_** in the flows of knowledge and know-how about food systems within, among, and outside public universities as they address "The Challenge of Change" will be the key determinant in how well they can achieve the goal of universal food security.

Openness, in this context, has two dimensions: First, it is behavioral.  People, in general, will do the greater good if they have information about context, knowledge about its significance, and know-how about steps to move forward.

Second, it is technical.  People will use available information and communication technology (ICT) and its associated systems, platforms, and applications to access, use, and contribute to open knowledge and know-how.

Openness as a combination of behavioral and technical elements features is a core organizing principle in several grand challenges developed by the working groups - our Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions (EEAS) working group among them.

## Global Food Security Partnerships

The opportunities we put forward would spawn purposeful, collaborative endeavors between APLU administration and fellow public and land-grant universities.  Seen holistically, this collective effort would forge a dynamic, yet powerful web of “global food security partnerships” which would have the capacity to:

* Strike a balance between honoring the institutional principles of higher education yet creating two-way flows of knowledge and know-how about food security with people in need wherever they may reside.
* Apply "open everything" as an essential system design principle to establish an _enabling environment for access and solutions_ and meet _the challenge of change_ head-on.
* Adopt, advocate for, and advance strategies, systems, platforms, applications, etc. that promote openness as a core value among public and private sector actors throughout the global food system.  

## APLU Member University Experiences

While these recommendations may seem out of reach, they are logical next steps in what has been a steady progression toward openness for over two decades.  For example, in many respects the Commission is the next phase in a long-range vision about global food security initially advanced in the mid-1990s by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF) as the [Food Systems Professions Education (FSPE)](https://joe.org/joe/1996october/a1.php "FSPE") - an initiative led by [Rick Foster](http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2010/foster-named-wk-kellogg-professor-at-michigan-state-university/ "Rick Foster"), who is also a member of our Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions working group.  Many of the universities participating in the 2050 Commission initiative were members of the cluster infrastructure for FSPE.  During the interim, most FSPE universities have implemented successive projects, programs, and initiatives that have increased, significantly, the capability for openness throughout academe and among regional / international stakeholders.  Areas where these developments occurred include the following:
* Platforms / open forums to facilitate open communication, processes, and tools that promote two-way flows of knowledge and know-how ([LocalFoodSystems.org](http://localfoodsystems.org "LFS"))
* Value network structures that promote open R&D, production, and distribution ([Greener Acres Value Network (GAVNet)](https://sites.google.com/a/greeneracres.us.com/greener-acres-value-network/home "GAVNet") / [SENSORICA Open Value Network](http://www.sensorica.co "Sensorica"))
* Path-to-market infrastructure for students, faculty, researchers as inventors, innovators, entrepreneurs ([Innovation Portfolio](http://innovation.iagri.org/home "Innovation Portfolio"))
* Public-private-people partnerships ([P4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275112002156 "P4 Article")) for the development and sustainability of open infrastructure and knowledge commons ([Data Cooperative](http://ocj.com/2015/06/osu-working-on-new-data-cooperative/ "Data Coop"))
* Alignment of departmental strategic orientation and staff selection / development to support horizontal intra-collegiate and intercollegiate initiatives ([Model of Change](http://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/international-programs/knowledge-center-for-advancing-development-through-higher-education/knowledge-center-documents/iagri-a-model-of-change-presentation-file.pdf "Model of Change - iAGRI and APLU"))  

Together, these and many more experiences provide a solid foundation upon which to catalyze institutional transformation more broadly.  This reality carries a particular significance for the 2050 Commission as it develops recommendations for legislative consideration in 2017.  

## Next Steps  

The links associated with the listed areas above lead to examples based on my experiences at Ohio State.  They do NOT represent the only or best “answer”.  Instead, they are simply ways that worked, to some degree.  More importantly, they may bring to mind examples within your own organizations that could be listed as well.  

Perhaps we could document our university experiences with increased openness and incorporate recommendations based on that shared reality into the narrative for sections “Description of Opportunity for Public Universities”; “Activities: Research, Teaching, and Engagement”; and “Consideration of Cross-cutting Issues: Institutional Transformation” for each “grand challenge”.  If so, the 2050 Commission members would have valuable material to act upon well in advance of submitting their report for legislative consideration.  Furthermore, words backed by action beforehand would give their recommendations more credence.

Potentially, a critical mass of APLU member universities could be attained sufficient to challenge the basic assumptions held by academe about the value of openness to change, and in so doing alter the very form and function of higher education in support of universal food security by 2050.  That would be a legacy well-worth leaving for APLU and Commission members!
