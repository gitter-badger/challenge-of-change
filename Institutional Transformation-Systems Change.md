### [Challenge of Change Commission](http://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/international-programs/challenge-of-change/FoodandNutritionOnePager.pdf)
> APLU has established a commission that will examine challenges to food security and make recommendations on the actions required by public research universities to meet global food needs by 2050. Historically, our public universities have been instrumental in solving agricultural challenges, but today’s food security issues are even more complex. These issues are multidimensional, crossing disciplinary & national borders, and solving them requires systems to change. Universities may be the only place where all relevant disciplines come together to address these complex, systemic issues.

### The “Challenge” in The Challenge of Change
The very title - "The Challenge of Change" - demands an effective change strategy be followed in the pursuit of global food security. The “wagon wheel” diagram below frames such a process and illustrates key relationships among the three major components, eight topic areas (working group charters), and four cross-cutting issues.

This diagram also exhibits an expansiveness of scope and degree of complexity inherent in the knowledge transfer associated with the subtitle, "Engaging Public Universities in Feeding the World".

The landscape is further complicated through a deeply-entrenched resistance to change within the current global food system.  The diagram below shows how a relatively small percentage of the global population controls a majority of the capacity within APLU universities to generate and provide access to knowledge and know-how that can address challenges to food security for all through teaching, research, and engagement.

The scope, scale, and complexity of this particular “challenge of change” impose certain "rules" or principles that drive expected behaviors within large systems change strategies. Examples include:
 1. ["If you want to build change, you have to start everywhere at once." - Margaret Mead](http://www.joe.org/joe/1996october/a1.php)
 2. ["Systems change involves the lives of everyone in the system undergoing that change." p.13](http://www.florida-rti.org/educatorresources/mtss_book_implcomp_012612.pdf)
 3. ["Changing the organization one conversation at a time"](http://www.groupjazz.com/documents/ODP-V45No2-Kimball.pdf)
 4. ["For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.” - H.L. Mencken p.5](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=EDU/CERI/CD/RD(2013)10&docLanguage=En)
 5. [Open everything, commons for all](http://commonstransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Commons-Transition_-Policy-Proposals-for-a-P2P-Foundation.pdf)  

Application of these **rules** would prompt the extensive use of platforms, apps, processes, and tools that encourage cross-boundary behaviors, attract individuals and groups from inside and outside universities, and lead to resources and support for food security projects and activities of mutual benefit for people, planet, and profit

### APLU Strategy for Change
Given the recalcitrance of the actors within the current food system to accept substantive change, external recommendations and seeking permission from them to truly “address challenges to food security” will likely fail. Instead, effective change will surface in the informal system as illustrated in the “theory of change” diagram below. The initial phase of the change strategy, then, would be to inspire myriad “conversations that matter”.

The views below (available as Google Slides at this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-FpPls6emY5HOpCcRX7SVW6H0wIc6xu9uDlkb-9aGo8)) present a [theory in practice](http://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/international-programs/knowledge-center-for-advancing-development-through-higher-education/knowledge-center-documents/iagri-a-model-of-change-presentation-file.pdf) for an APLU-brokered systems change / institutional transformation strategy.  The slides highlight communication, infrastructure, portfolio, and crowdfunding as interdependent steps that, when taken, have the potential to disrupt the dominant power structure and, in its stead, develop new pathways that enable people to meet their basic food needs regardless of locality.  The net effect, then, would be to reduce, if not eliminate, food insecurity worldwide.

### We need not wait...
> If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change.  As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. ... We need not wait to see what others do. - Gandhi

This [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxdGRSb8tFu1dnFBX2h5U3dEVmM) leads to a “mind map” of The Challenge of Change: Engaging Public Universities in Feeding the World.  It includes examples of systems change initiatives catalyzed by APLU members: The Ohio State University and Michigan Technological University.  Neither example offers the “right answer” nor necessarily a stellar approach. However, they could inspire innovative combinations of "activities, resources, and actors" that effectively address "grand challenges".  Within the framework of the mind map may be prompts for more expansive "conversations that matter", prolific experimentation to develop "ways that work", and widespread adoption of "changes that sustain". 

Ultimately, change strategies developed by the working groups should start well ahead of the Commission’s final report in January 2017 as evidence of their efficacy.  The activities initiated would begin to ease institutions along paths of transformation that preserve their integrity yet significantly increases access by a majority of people to knowledge and know-how about their global food system. 

To set these strategies into motion, working group members will have to reconcile competing interests inherent in their charters, namely, 1) how to develop a report that recommends those courses of action which have the potential to advance on "grand challenges" during the next 1 - 5 years; and, 2) how to inspire a critical mass of actors to disrupt the deep-seated patterns of behavior within the current food system to which they belong (and are often recognized and rewarded by) and redefine or replace that same system (often by adapting to some version of the submitted recommendations!) so that everyone can meet their basic food needs. 

These two channels are not easily meshed, but they must be worked in concert with one another for the ultimate goal of universal food security to be achieved.  In fact, if the disruption-adaptation channel isn't already running well ahead of the report-recommendation channel, there may not be much impact.

How do we start NOW to use our global networks and open communication platforms to spread the word about the significance of The Challenge of Change initiative?

How do we to invite and empower those who exhibit vitality, resourcefulness, creative passion, and social media savvy to convene conversations that matter and search for ways that work?

**Rule #1:** "If you want to build change, you have to start everywhere at once."
