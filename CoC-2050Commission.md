# Challenge of Change: 2050 Commission
## [2050 Commission][1]
**Background:**
> APLU has established a commission that will examine challenges to food security and make recommendations on the actions required by public research universities to meet global food needs by 2050. Historically, our public universities have been instrumental in solving agricultural challenges, but today’s food security issues are even more complex. These issues are multidimensional, crossing disciplinary & national borders, and solving them requires systems to change. Universities may be the only place where all relevant disciplines come together to address these complex, systemic issues.
**Project Objectives:**
> The objectives of this project are to identify:
> * Key constraints to our food system’s ability to sustainably feed the world
> * How institutions  of higher education can best provide knowledge to remove food security constraints
> * How resources from the public and private sector can be aligned to support solutions
**[Charge of the Commission][2]**

## [2050 Commission Working Groups][3]
**[Scope of Work for Working Groups][4]**
> 1. Refine the general description of how the topic fits into the component of food security. Provide detail of the underlying processes that impact how the topic interacts with food security.
> 2. Define 5-10 key challenges that are constraints to achieving food security in the topic area. 
> 3. Develop a problem model for each key challenge that lays out the functional relationships and identifies the key constraints that need to be addressed within the challenge.
> 4. Consider how the cross-cutting issues impact the working group topic (Institutional Transformation, Climate Change, Policy and Trade, Environmental Effects and Impacts).
> 5. Identify key institutional barriers to achieving these challenges and recommend possible solutions.
> 6. Make suggestions of alignment of university resources (broadly defined to include human resources, structural, financial, etc.) to be improve research effectiveness.
> 7. Produce an 8-10 page document lays out the above items with compelling arguments
