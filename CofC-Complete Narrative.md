# **The Challenge of Change: Engaging Public Universities to Feed the World**

## **1) 2050 Commission**

### **[Commission Background][1]**
APLU has established a commission that will examine challenges to food security and make recommendations on the actions required by public research universities to meet global food needs by 2050. Historically, our public universities have been instrumental in solving agricultural challenges, but today’s food security issues are even more complex. These issues are multidimensional, crossing disciplinary & national borders, and solving them requires systems to change. Universities may be the only place where all relevant disciplines come together to address these complex, systemic issues.

### **[About the Challenge of Change Commission][2]**

### **[Charge of the Commission][3]**

### **[Project Objectives][4] are to identify**:
* Key constraints to our food system’s ability to sustainably feed the world
* How institutions  of higher education can best provide knowledge to remove food security constraints
* How resources from the public and private sector can be aligned to support solutions

## **2) Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions (EEAS) - Background**

### **[Scope of Work for Working Groups][5]**  

### **[Revised Working Group Topics][6]**

- **[Component Two: Access][7]**  
	The second component of food security, Access, means having sufficient resources and access to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious and culturally appropriate diet. As with availability, access has a number of contributing factors. Local populations must be able to participate in an enabling environment that allows input into the food systems. Factors related to inclusion and equity across a number of considerations are also critical.

- **[Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions][8]**  
	All people deserve access to healthy and affordable food, and local, national and international policy environments that enable this access and which provide opportunities for engagement. Local communities can be empowered to have more input into both local and national food systems.

- **[Cross-Cutting Issues][9]**  
	Cutting across all three components of food security, as well as the domestic and global aspects of the work of the commission are four factors: Institutional Transformation of public universities, Climate Change, the Policy Environment, and Environmental Effects and Impacts. These four cross-cutting issues should be embedded across all eight working groups as opposed to forming working groups of their own. This approach will ensure that the cross cutting issues will be considered within the context of the working group topics. The Commission will integrate the cross cutting issues into the challenges identified by the working groups.

	- **[Institutional Transformation][10]**  
		Historically, our North American public universities have been instrumental in solving agricultural challenges, but today’s food security issues are even more complex. These issues are multidimensional, crossing disciplinary and national borders, and solving them requires understanding food systems and how they interact with the social and economic environment to make positive change happen. Universities may be the only place where all relevant disciplines come together to address these complex, systemic issues. The commission will identify, drawing on external expertise, an initial framework of the required research, institutional strengthening, human resources requirements and university organization and function needed to meet this challenge.  
		**[Institutional transformation][11]** is particularly critical for developing countries, and it is hoped that the lessons learned for transformation of North American public universities could also be adapted to create institutional transformation for public universities in developing countries. For example, Africa is faced with promise and peril. One half of the 2 billion plus people to be added to the planet by 2050 will be African. Over the next decades, the continent will either be a source of human capital and creativity to produce the science and social conditions for food security or a source of instability that makes food insecurity a continental challenge. The quality of higher education institutions in developing countries is critical in determining that outcome.

## **4) APLU Strategy for Change**

### **The Problem**  
How can APLU influence public universities to adopt methods of teaching, research, and engagement based on openness, asynchronicity, and synergy

- What we have always done still works
- Show me where universities have been successful with the approach you propose
- We don't know how - and no one else does either
- What you propose will create confusion, cost too much and take too long

### **The Strategy**  
Promote platforms, apps, processes, and tools that encourage cross-boundary behaviors, easily attract individuals and groups inside and outside universities, and lead to resources and support for food security projects and activities of mutual benefit for people, planet, and profit

- Proposal Submission Selection Criteria

### Consulting Services Scope of Work
_Communications:_ Broker connections, post to social media, and develop presentations that strengthen leadership development, change management / institutional change, and Innovation Portfolio / solution development adoption underway at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA).  

Develop communication objectives and identify the strategic orientation for the Office of International Programs in Agriculture (IPA) within the College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) at The Ohio State University (OSU) in relation to iAGRI project activities.

_Training:_ Develop materials and co-deliver as needed workshops and experiential learning forums as part of leadership development, change management / institutional change, and Innovation Portfolio / solution development adoption

_Coaching:_ Provide targeted coaching sessions through phone / Skype calls, personal email, and face-to-face visits for members of SUA's administration and academic staff involved in leadership development and change management / institutional change, and innovators involved in the Innovation Portfolio and solution development.  

Provide coaching to directly support the goals of IPA and align with the role of the iAGRI Management Entity (ME) for iAGRI.

### **iAGRI Innovation Portfolio - Expanded**
- Expand capability of iAGRI Innovation Portfolio by leveraging concurrent development of a “commercial innovation portfolio” with Aimpoint Research that could handle proprietary and closed projects within a university setting where protection and licensure of intellectual property has a high priority.
- Coordinate with FABE administration to ensure OSU “partnership” in development of the platform and takes advantage of departmental experience with the iAGRI Innovation Portfolio through FABE-related projects posted to it and two administrative visits to the iAGRI office and SUA campus in Morogoro during FY2014 and FY2015
- Expand capability of iAGRI Innovation Portfolio by leveraging concurrent development of an “open value network” approach as exemplified by the SENSORICA Open Value Network (OVN) - ACES/CAKE, and the application of Creative Commons licensure to the List of Projects that comprise the SENSORICA portfolio and honor the intent of the innovator in how to use project results.

### **Office of International Programs in Agriculture (IPA)**

#### **Strategic Orientation / Strategic Opportunities**
- Exploit confirmed areas of interest by public, private, and voluntary sector investors / sponsors / collaborators / partners for development, submission, and administration of high-potential project proposals
- Establish “international programs” as a **trusted convening agent** among intra / intercollegiate and inter-institutional affiliates
- Build faculty (college and university) capacity for internationalization

#### **Staffing**
- Initiate changes in IPA administrative structure that increase the capacity and capability of IPA to take advantage of opportunities presented by having a deeper presence on campus.
- Develop hiring strategies and outline key points to include in draft descriptions for IPA / iAGRI administrative positions.
- Establish connections with P2P Foundation founder, Michel Bauwens, and core team members as potential resources in searches for candidates with experience in innovative HICD models who could fill administrative positions within IPA, iAGRI, and future grant / contract funded programs.

#### **Institutional Change Strategy**
Continue development and implementation of an organization design /institutional change strategy within IPA, CFAES, and OSU that parallels the “Conversations That Matter (CTM) - Ways That Work (WTW) - Changes That Sustain (CTS)” institutional change model applied by iAGRI at SUA and increases the potential for cross-institutional learning and adaptation among all participating entities.
##### **Communication Platform**
Establish an online communication forum (GAVNet) using the Slack platform so that participants can spawn a diverse range of “Conversations That Matter” about individual and collective experiences in the field of international development and lead to collaborative projects in the search for “Ways That Work” that can inform and drive “Changes That Sustain” within the formal systems of participating organizations and to better support IPA, overall, and iAGRI, in particular, as it enters its final full year of funding with the possibility for second phase funding.  
The GAVNet platform facilitates the following activities:
 - Identify projects for products, services, infrastructure, and technologies that could appeal, commercially, within iAGRI's purview
- Develop open source systems, processes, and tools that would have relevance in an iAGRI context both in terms of usefulness, but for students and faculty at SUA to be involved in their development and deployment
- Enhance the reputation of IPA and expand the base of on-campus support for its programs, like iAGRI, as the administrative structure for the CFAES and the OSU continued to undergo significant changes in key personnel, roles and responsibilities, campus location, organizational centrality, and leadership respect.

#### **Cross-Boundary Behaviors**
- Connect IPA with key personnel from other departments, colleges, and offices across campus in the development of projects, systems, processes, tools, etc. that would play well in IPA venues and create opportunities for more campus-wide engagement in IPA initiatives.
- Build upon the already established associations between IPA / iAGRI and CFAES / OSU administration / faculty / staff as well as representatives of commercial interests who have participated in joint projects with OSU partners.  The combination of both groups strengthens connections with agricultural and irrigation equipment industry members seeking to expand marketing manufacturing, and distribution channels in Tanzania and /or India.
