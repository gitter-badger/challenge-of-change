# The Challenge of Change: Engaging Public Universities to Feed the World - A Strategy for Change

The very wording of the title - "The Challenge of Change" - demands an effective change strategy be followed in the pursuit of success.  The outline at this [link](https://github.com/stevebosserman/challenge-of-change/blob/master/CofC-Complete%20Narrative.md) presents a way to envision such a process.  The [mind map](https://github.com/stevebosserman/challenge-of-change/blob/master/Enabling%20Environment%20for%20Access%20and%20Solutions.pdf "EEAS MindNote mind map") accompanying the outline provides a visual copy of the points described in the text and illustrates some of the key relationships among them.

Furthermore, the knowledge transfer associated with the subtitle, "Engaging Public Universities in Feeding the World", possesses an expansiveness of scope and degree of complexity that, by default, imposes certain "rules" that bound broad-based systems change strategies.  Among these are:
 1. ["If you want to build change, you have to start everywhere at once." - Margaret Mead](http://www.joe.org/joe/1996october/a1.php)
 2. ["Systems change involves the lives of everyone in the system undergoing that change." p.13](http://www.florida-rti.org/educatorresources/mtss_book_implcomp_012612.pdf)
 3. ["Changing the organization one conversation at a time"](http://www.groupjazz.com/documents/ODP-V45No2-Kimball.pdf)
 4. ["For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.‚Äù - H.L. Mencken p.5](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=EDU/CERI/CD/RD(2013)10&docLanguage=En)
 5. [Open everything, commons for all](http://commonstransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Commons-Transition_-Policy-Proposals-for-a-P2P-Foundation.pdf)

The outline explores a single theme - The Challenge of Change: Engaging Public Universities to Feed the World - with six topical areas:
 1. 2050 Commission
 2. Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions (EEAS) - Background
 3. EEAS - Reports
 4. APLU Strategy for Change
 5. Institutional Change Example
 6. Open Everything Example

The first three pertain directly to the charges of the commission and working groups, specifically, Enabling Environment for Access and Solutions (EEAS). The fourth focuses on APLU as an "agent for change".  The fifth and sixth offer practical examples of change strategies.  More specifically, Topic 5 highlights several activities associated with the [Innovative Agricultural Research Initiative (iAGRI)](http://iagri.org) both in the project office on the [Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA)](http://suanet.ac.tz) campus in Morogoro, Tanzania and at [International Programs in Agriculture](http://ipa.osu.edu), the Management Entity (ME) for iAGRI on the Ohio State campus in Columbus, Ohio, whereas Topic 6, "Open Everything", concentrates on the collaboration among members of the [SENSORICA Open Value Network](http://www.sensorica.co), [Mikorizal Software](http://www.mikorizal.org), the [P2P Foundation](http://p2pfoundation.net), among others.

Topic 3, EEAS-Reports, displays a series of five views (available as Google Slides at this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-FpPls6emY5HOpCcRX7SVW6H0wIc6xu9uDlkb-9aGo8)) that outlines an APLU-brokered systems change strategy (see Topic 4) for "institutional transformation".  The opening slide focuses attention on how the absence of access to knowledge and know-how constitutes a major hurdle to food security.  The ensuing framework for change covers four interdependent realms - communication, infrastructure, portfolio, and crowdfunding - which honor the set of "rules" mentioned above. Over time, this approach has the potential to disrupt the power structure that currently prevents access and, in its stead, develop new pathways that enable people to meet their basic food needs regardless of locality.

The examples of strategies for institutional transformation outlined in Topics 5 and 6 are open for consideration, albeit within particular contexts.  As such, neither offers the right answer nor the best approach.  However, they could inspire innovative combinations of "activities, resources, and actors" that effectively address "grand challenges".  Moreover, in keeping with a basic [theory of change](https://github.com/stevebosserman/challenge-of-change/blob/master/Theory%20of%20Change-30.jpg), they may be prompts for more expansive "conversations that matter", prolific experimentation with "ways that work", and widespread adoption of "changes that sustain".  Ultimately, change strategies should ease institutions along a path of transformation that preserves their integrity yet significantly increases access by a majority of people to knowledge and know-how about their global food system. The net effect, then, would be to further empower people to reduce, if not eliminate, food insecurity worldwide. 

What conversations does APLU want to convene?"
